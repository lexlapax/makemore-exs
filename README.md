# Makemore
Makemore elixis based on the teachings of [Andrej Karpathy | github](https://github.com/karpathy)

> Take a look at https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero
> 
> Specifically the jupyter notebooks https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master/lectures/makemore 
that I've tried to recreate in [Elixir Livebooks](https://livebook.dev/)
> 
> The series is culminated at https://github.com/karpathy/makemore that's runnable code in one python script. 

This is not elixir magic, at most, it's my humble beginnings in learning 
- functional programming for pragmatic reasons.. produce code in production everywhere that is functional
- programming in elixir, i love ruby, like the thinking and production use of erlang/beam/ots.. need to do this
- neural networks and machine learning.. need to grok this.

Folks who are functional, erlang, elixir proficient, this is not idiomatic code.. feel free to submit changes, issues etc, or fork it.. 

**TODO: Add description**
