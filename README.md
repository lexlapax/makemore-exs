# Makemore
Makemore elixis based on the teachings of [Andrej Karpathy | github](https://github.com/karpathy)

> Take a look at Https://github.com/karpathy/nnZeroToHero
> 
> Specifically the jupyter notebooks https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master/lectures/makemore 
that I've tried to recreate in [Elixir Livebooks](https://livebook.dev/)
> 
> The series is culminated at https://github.com/karpathy/makemore that's runnable code in one python script. 

This is not elixir magic, at most, it's my humble beginnings in learning at 
- functional programming - for pragmatic reasons.. produce code that is "function then form" .. beautiful but production ready, and mostly logic error free
- programming in elixir - i love ruby. easy to use, streaming (pipes anyone?) like the thinking and production use of erlang/beam/ots
- neural networks and machine learning -  need to grok this , but based on above

Folks who are functional, erlang, elixir proficient, this is not idiomatic code.. feel free to submit changes, issues etc, or fork it..
