This is not elixir magic, at most, it's my humble beginnings in learning 
- functional programming for pragmatic reasons.. produce code in production everywhere that is functional
- programming in elixir, i love ruby, like the thinking and production use of erlang/beam/ots.. need to do this
- neural networks and machine learning.. need to grok this.

Folks who are functional, erlang, elixir proficient, this is not idiomatic code.. feel free to submit changes, issues etc, or fork it..
